# dotfiles

My dotfiles:

* `vimrc_windows`    : For Vim for Windows.
* `.vimrc_mintty`    : For a well behaved Vim in minTTY in Windows.
* `.vimrc`           : For Vim on *normal* operating systems.
* `muttrc`           : For the Mutt mail program.

`.config`:
* `i3/config`        : Badly patched together i3 config that started out as a
                       sway config.  Not pretty, needs work.
* `git/config        : Git config
